# Musicana

Musicana uses IBM's world class tone recognition api as well as twitter's handy api and combines it into the most sophiisticated twitter bot the world has ever seen. When tweeted at, Musicana uses the song, analyses its lyrics, gathers its tones, cross-references it agaist thousands of songs, and tweets you back with the song that most closely resembles your mood.
